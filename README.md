As part of CS-646 coursework, Akash and I decided to work on a Chat Application similar to WhatsApp. 

Major functionalities of our Chat App:
      1.) Phone Authentication.
      2.) Sync Contacts to find friends who have registered for the App.
      3.) User can send message to any of his/her contacts who registered for the App.
      4.) Notification sent when User receives a message and App is in "Background".
      5.) Logout Feature implemented.
      6.) User can upload their Profile picture and set a Display Image.
      7.) User can update their Profile picture and Display Image.
      8.) Profile Picture was compressed to speed up loading.
      
Future Scope:
      1.) Notification should be sent when App in Foreground too.
      2.) Save all chats in SQLite and not in firebase. (We tried doing it but couldn't finish it due to time constraints)
      3.) "Last seen"/"seen" feature of WhatsApp
      4.) Share Images
      5.) Group Chat

Known Errors:
      1.) While Syncing contacts and fetching contacts that registered the App we couldn't show the progress Bar.(But achieved the same in Activity.)
